//! `Shard` : the composition layer.
//!
//! Composes one of each persistence primitive ([`Wal`], [`VectorStore`],
//! [`MetadataStore`]) and an in-memory [`HnswIndex`] on top of the vector
//! store. Generic over all four so the same `Shard` type drives both the
//! production combo (`FileWal + MmapVectorStore + FileMetadataStore`) and
//! test fixtures (`InMemoryWal + InMemoryVectorStore + InMemoryMetadataStore`),
//! and so future backends (S3, distributed log, columnar metadata) plug in
//! without touching this file.
//!
//! The load-bearing rule is **log-then-mutate** : every `insert` appends a
//! [`Record`](crate::Record) to the WAL and `sync`s it before any in-memory
//! or on-disk state changes. On crash, the WAL is the witness ; recovery
//! replays it on reopen, idempotently re-applying every record to the
//! stores and the index.
//!
//! # Layout on disk (when composed with file-backed primitives)
//!
//! ```text
//! data_dir/
//!   wal/             <- FileWal segments
//!   vectors.mmap     <- MmapVectorStore file
//!   metadata.bin     <- FileMetadataStore file
//! ```
